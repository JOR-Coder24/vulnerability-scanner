# System Vulnerability Scanner

This tool performs a system vulnerability scan by gathering system information, checking for installed programs and web applications, and cross-referencing them with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to detect known vulnerabilities. It generates a report with relevant system details and detected vulnerabilities.

## Features
- **System Information Collection**: Gathers details such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, OS version, installed programs, and web applications.
- **Installed Program Detection**: Scans the Windows registry to retrieve installed programs.
- **Web Application Detection**: Checks for common web server and application frameworks (e.g., XAMPP, IIS, Apache, Nginx) on the system.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Fetches data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API and checks for known vulnerabilities related to installed programs and web applications.
- **Vulnerability Report**: Generates a detailed report in text format with system information and detected vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `psutil`: For system resource usage information.
  - `requests`: For fetching data from the NVD API.
  - `winreg`: To interact with the Windows registry (only works on Windows).

Install required libraries with:
```bash
pip install psutil requests
```

## Usage

1. **Run the script**: To start the vulnerability scan, simply run the Python script.

```bash
python vulnerability_scanner.py
```

2. **Scan Process**: 
   - The tool will gather system information (CPU usage, memory, disk usage, OS version, installed programs, and web apps).
   - It will then check for known vulnerabilities by querying the NVD API.
   - A report will be generated and saved as `vulnerability_report2.txt` in the current working directory.

3. **Report**: The generated report will include:
   - **System Information**: CPU, memory, disk usage, OS version, installed programs, and web applications.
   - **Detected Vulnerabilities**: A list of vulnerabilities associated with installed programs and web apps, including CVE ID, description, and severity.

## Example Output
